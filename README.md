This was a challenging project for me. It took me far longer than I thought. It was my first time attempting the MERN stack and that was a challenge in of itself. I had issues integrating React with the backend, really took me a while to figure out. This was also really my first time using JWT as well, that took a bulk of my time as well but I did learn a lot with using it for my authentication. I stored my tokens in session storage which I know is not the best but it was fun to learn about doing it that way. With mongoDB I feel I did not really much trouble, only thing was using the REST functions on the frontend took some figuring out, I decided to use Axios but I also did learn it the 'vanilla' way, also on an unrelated note, my React skills improved a bit and my code is quite a bit cleaner than my older projects. All in all I am quite satisfied with the project and excited to hone my skills further and make better projects.
